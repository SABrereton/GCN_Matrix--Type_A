=== Version 2 - [19-07-2025] ===

* Altered the algorithm used when a participant can't take their turn.

  The cursor now moves to a random position containing a number
  instead of the last X and Y position in the Matrix which contained a
  number when checking if the Matrix has been emptied.

* When a participant can't take their turn a message is now displayed
  informing participants of the situation and of the cursor being
  relocated.


=== Version 1 - [24-05-2025] ===

Initial version.

Consists of a fork from the type-in program "Matrix" as published
in the June 1983 issue of "Sinclair Programs" magazine.

Used the process of entering the listing of "Matrix" into a text based
.bas file and using the program "ZXText2P" to compile the .bas file
into a .p file format which can be read by Sinclair ZX81 compatible
hardware and software.

Notes, observations and/or changes follow:

    * 8K BASIC source code accepted by ZXText2P is not 100% compatible
      with Sinclair 8K BASIC.

    * In Sinclair 8K BASIC when using the PRINT command, in-order to
      display the quote symbol (") within a string a second quote
      symbol must be used as the prefix in an escape code
      sequence ("").
      
      ZXText2P which was used to compile this version instead requires
      that the backslash character (\) be used as the prefix in escape
      code sequences so the requisite changes had to be made
      throughout the program code before ZXText2P would compile the
      program.

    * ZXText2P enables the use of source code comments by ignoring
      lines beginning with a # character during the compilation
      process thus saving space/memory in the outputted .p by
      reducing the need to use REM statements. With this in mind this
      method was used for source code comments.

    * Added a section to the beginnning of the program's source code
      designed to provide some information about the program to anyone
      looking at the source code.

    * Added a "Main Menu" screen and made this the point at which the
      program opens up to users.
      
      From the Main Menu users can select from a number of actions
      which includes playing the Matrix game and exiting the program.
      
    * Added a series of screens with credit and credit related
      information on them which are accessible from the "Main Menu"
      screen.

    * Added a series of screens with instructional information on them
      which are accessible from the "Main Menu" screen.

    * Added a two player mode. Second player has seperate controls to
      let both players simultaneously have access to keyboard so no
      need to keep swapping who is near keyboard.

    * Changed Player One controls to use [A] & [Z] keys for cursor
      movement and [X] to select a number and set Player Two controls
      to [O] & [P] keys for cursor movement and [K] to select a
      number.

    * Swapped number selection between Player One and CPU player.
      Player One now selects numbers vertically and CPU player selects
      numbers horizontally.

    * Set Player Two movement to select numbers horizontally.

    * Changed the button used to end a game early from the [U] key to
      the [5] key. Also ensured that this can only be used upon the
      turn of player 1 to ensure that both players have had an equal
      number of turns when the game is ended.

    * No longer request that players input a name to be used
      throughout a game as it seemed a bit superfluous, taking up
      memory for little purpose.

      Instead using the labels "Player 1", "CPU" and "Player 2",
      output as string literals.

    * Fixed the Matrix not being randomised by seeding the random
      number generator based on the system's internal clock whenever
      a new game is being prepared.

    * Changed the screen displayed pre-game whilst the Matrix is
      randomised from a static screen with a "please wait" style
      message to a screen featuring a countdown conveying a visual
      representation of progress to users.

    * Made the Matrix center aligned on the game screen instead of
      left aligned.

    * On the game screen - Inverted the colours of the text informing
      of who's turn it currently is in an attempt to make it stand out.

    * A game now ends when there are no numbers left in the Matrix not
      when there are no numbers available to select from the current
      cursor position. If there are no numbers to select from the
      current position then the cursor is now automatically moved to a
      position containing a number.

    * Altered the "Game Over" screen both in terms of the what is
      displayed and where it is positioned. Also added the option to
      either play another game or return to the "Main Menu" screen.

    * Altered some existing variable names to be more meaningful and
      tried to use meaningful names for new variables.
