### About this document / Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide some information about
GCN Ghost Chase - Type A.


### About GCN Ghost Chase - Type A

GCN Ghost Chase is an arcade style game developed by Stuart Antony
Brereton and the Great Collective Nobody.

GCN Ghost Chase was forked from "Ghost Chase" by Neal Cavalier-Smith
and Graham White, published in 1983 in the book "49 Explosive Games for
the ZX Spectrum" by Interface Publications which was authored by
Tim Hartnell - ISBN 0 907563 53 8.

The "Type A" designation in this case means that this fork shall use
the same flat two dimensional graphics with top-down viewpoint during
gameplay as the original "Ghost Chase" program.


### Implementations

Implementations are forks of GCN Ghost Chase - Type A. The concept behind
this scheme is to provide flexibility to attempt to "implement" the
same general program using different development methods.

The implementations that have currently been released are as follows:

- Imp00001 - [ Target platform(s): Sinclair ZX Spectrum compatible hardware and software ]
    
    The purpose of this implementation is to predominantly use the
    Sinclair 48 BASIC programming language to develop versions of
    GCN Ghost Chase - Type A that will run on Sinclair ZX Spectrum
    compatible hardware and software.
