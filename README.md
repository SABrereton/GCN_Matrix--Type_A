### About this document / Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide some information about
GCN Matrix - Type A.


### About GCN Matrix - Type A

GCN Ghost Chase is an strategy style game developed by Stuart Antony
Brereton and the Great Collective Nobody.

GCN Matrix was forked from "Matrix" by T.J. Marrow/James Marrow,
published in the June 1983 issue of "Sinclair Programs" magazine by
ECC Publications of London in 1983 - ISSN No. 0263-0265.

The "Type A" designation in this case means that this fork shall use
the same alphanumeric based interface during gameplay as the original
"Matrix" program.


### Implementations

Implementations are forks of GCN Matrix - Type A. The concept behind
this scheme is to provide flexibility to attempt to "implement" the
same general program using different development methods.

The implementations that have currently been released are as follows:

- Imp00001 - [ Target platform(s): Hardware and software that is compatible with Sinclair ZX81 systems that have 16KB of memory]
    
    The purpose of this implementation is to predominantly use the
    Sinclair 48 BASIC programming language to develop versions of
    GCN Ghost Chase - Type A that will run on Sinclair ZX Spectrum
    compatible hardware and software.
